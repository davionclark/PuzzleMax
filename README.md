PuzzleMax is an application written in Java using Android Studio. It is designed to run on devices using Android 7.0 Nougat. The application is a simple puzzle game that takes a picture, breaks it up into nine pieces and scrambles it. The user can click on the squares to swap the positions of the images. When all the images are in their original positions, the puzzle is completed.
